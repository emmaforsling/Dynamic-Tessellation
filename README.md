# Dynamic-Tessellation
The application is compiled and tested only on OSX.

This project utilizes the OpenGL Graphics Engine as a submodule.
When this project is cloned, the folder containing the submodule may look empty. To retrieve its content and get the latest update, run these commands in the terminal:
* "git submodule init"
* "git submodule update"

How to compile and run the application using the terminal:
  1. "mkdir bin"
  2. "make"
  3. "make run"

Or, instead of 2 and 3: "make sense" =)
