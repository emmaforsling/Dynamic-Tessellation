# Dynamic-Tessellation
This project utilizes the OpenGL Graphics Engine as a submodule.
When this project is cloned, this folder may look empty. To retrieve what it contains and get the latest update, run these commands in the terminal:
* "git submodule init"
* "git submodule update"

How to comile and run the application using the terminal:
1. "mkdir bin"
2. "make"
3. "make run"

Or, instead of 2 and 3: "make sense" =)
